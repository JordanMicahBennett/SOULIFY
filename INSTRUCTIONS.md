Topic: A flavourful music/video archiver micro-social-network, allowing users the ability to 'soulify' content (via google chrome)
from any (okay most) music/video website, to their "soulify" profile @ http://soulify.tk which is an alias for http://soulify.honor.es

Usage: 
1.Sign up @http://soulify.tk
2.You will be automatically signed in at sign up.
3.a.After sign up, and sign in, get extension. Follow instructions to add chrome extension.
3.b.Cookies will automatically some of your user data, as a state maintenance routine, as means to
archive/send information via that site to your profile.
4.Refresh page, sign in once more, navigate to the segment you "soulified".
5.Soulify allows users to attach flavours by essentially colouring your music categories, by mood colours.
6.Any mood manipulation is "remembered" but not all mood activities or saved; 
	i.Changing the mood of a category, then toggling save, will save this category with selected mood (this category's frontend changes), along with the entire frontend. (eg of remembering + saving FOR BOTH FRONTEND CATEGORY AND ENTIRE FRONTEND)..The next time the user logs in, the entire front end will reflect the last mood change, and said category will recall the mood change.
	
	ii.Changing the mood of a category, then NOT toggling save, will NOT save this category with selected mood (though this category's frontend changes), along with the entire frontend. (eg of remembering + NOT saving FOR FRONTEND CATEGORY BUT saving ENTIRE FRONTEND)..The next time the user logs in, the entire front end will reflect the last mood change, HOWEVER said category will NOT recall the mood change.
